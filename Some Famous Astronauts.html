            A special part of the mission was the twins study, in which Scott was compared with the earthbound Mark to
            understand the medical effects of long spaceflight, such as astronauts would experience on a yearlong flight
            to Mars. Scott and Korniyenko returned to Earth on March 2, 2016. The following year Scott published the
            memoir Endurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery.<p>
